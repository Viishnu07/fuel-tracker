## üîí Cybersecurity Disclaimer

As a final-year cybersecurity student, I want to note that this was a personal "vibecoding" project.

This app prioritizes rapid development and functionality over security. It **does not** fully follow secure software development best practices (e.g., no password hashing, minimal input validation, plain-text password in code).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Please use this for personal, non-sensitive data only.** It is intended for educational and local use, not for production.

-   [ ] Add support for tracking multiple vehicles.
-   [ ] Include expense tracking for maintenance, tolls, and insurance.
-   [ ] Add a data export-to-CSV feature.
